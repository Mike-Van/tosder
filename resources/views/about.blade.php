        <p>
            We bring values to the outside world and, in the same time, we embrace the responsibility for the existing values preservation,
            especially Cambodia tourism. Cambodia tourism specifically is growing day by day together with direct and indirect
            demand. In a poor country, the obvious wealth of people from developed countries is a powerful lure. Unsustainable
            use of natural areas and exploitation of natural resources is a growing concern. Generally, it is a big issue
            for most of undeveloped countries; that is not obtaining income from tourism activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, unlike many Cambodia tour companies, we take our responsibility towards protecting the culture and environment of the
            countries. We call upon visitors to keep the originality of each destination including people, culture, environment
            and society. We develop Cambodia tourism and oriented countries as a means of improving the income of local people.
